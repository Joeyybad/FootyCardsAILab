# General Objective: FootyCards AI Lab

The goal of this project is to create a premium, high-fidelity football card collection application (akin to a digital Pokedex for Panini stickers). 

## Core Pillars
1. **AI-Powered Scouting**: Use Gemini 3 Flash and Google Search Grounding to fetch real-time or historical data about football players to generate realistic cards.
2. **Generative Portraits**: Utilize Gemini 2.5 Flash Image to generate high-quality sports photography style portraits for every card.
3. **Collection Management**: Allow users to browse, filter, and manage their collection of digital stickers.
4. **Market Simulation**: Each card includes a dynamic market value and rarity level (Common to Legendary) to simulate a trading card economy.

## Target User
Football enthusiasts and card collectors who want to "scout" their favorite players or generate "What If" scenarios (e.g., a legendary card for a rising star).
