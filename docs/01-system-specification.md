# 01 - System Specification: FootyCards AI Lab

## 1. Project Overview
The FootyCards AI Lab shall be a premium web application designed to simulate a high-end football card collection experience. The system will allow users to generate digital cards for real-world players using advanced AI grounding.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **FR1 (Scouting)**: The system shall accept a text query for any professional football player.
- **FR2 (Data Accuracy)**: The system must use real-time grounding to fetch accurate statistics (Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, Defending, Physical).
- **FR3 (Image Generation)**: The system shall attempt to generate a high-fidelity artistic portrait for every scouted player.
- **FR4 (Persistence)**: The collection shall be persisted using the browser's local storage.
- **FR5 (Economy)**: Every card will be assigned a market value and rarity tier based on real-world prestige.

## 3. Methodological Goal
This project follows a "Spec-First" methodology where technical constraints and data schemas are defined prior to implementation to ensure consistency across the AI-driven pipeline.
