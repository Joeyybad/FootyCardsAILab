# 05 - Image Sourcing & Safety Policy

## 1. Tiered Hybrid Pipeline
Due to safety filters on athlete likenesses, the system enforces three tiers of image acquisition:
- **Tier 1 (AI)**: High-fidelity generative portrait.
- **Tier 2 (Grounded)**: Direct web-link identified by Google Search during scouting.
- **Tier 3 (Manual)**: Pre-configured search triggers for the user.

## 2. Synchronization
Filter buttons and card status badges must remain visually synchronized through a case-insensitive normalization layer to handle various AI outputs.
