# 04 - UX Design: The Collector's Interface

## Design Language
- **Typography**: `Oswald` for high-impact sports headers; `Inter` for data legibility.
- **Theme System**:
  - **Dark (Laboratory)**: Professional, focused, high-contrast.
  - **Light (Stadium)**: Bright, clean, accessible.

## Battle Arena
The comparison mode allows selecting exactly two cards. 
- **Logic**: Compares individual stat keys (e.g., `pace`).
- **Visuals**: The winning stat is highlighted in green with a scale-up animation.
- **Layout**: Adaptive grid that switches from side-by-side (Desktop) to stacked (Mobile).
