# 01 - System Vision: FootyCards AI Lab

## 1. Executive Summary
The FootyCards AI Lab is a high-end digital collection platform. It aims to bridge real-world football data with generative AI artistry to create a "Digital Pokedex" of football stars. 

## 2. Methodological Approach (Spec-First)
This project follows a strict **Spec Driven Method**. All technical interfaces, data models, and UI standards are defined in this `docs/` directory prior to codebase initialization. This ensures that AI prompts and logic remain synchronized with the system's business rules.

## 3. The Scouting Loop
1. **Search**: The user initiates a scouting request for a specific athlete.
2. **Grounding**: The system shall utilize real-time web grounding to verify statistics.
3. **Synthesis**: The system shall generate a bespoke, high-fidelity portrait.
4. **Archiving**: Validated cards are stored in the user's local treasury.
